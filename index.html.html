        <p><strong>COVID-19 Information:</strong></p>
        <p>On-campus activities at the University of Chicago are limited. Classes are being taught on campus and online.<br>
            Currently, applicants cannot visit the university in person. Visit collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/visit to register for<br>
            virtual visit activities and see updates about on-campus visiting opportunities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Established in 1856, the University of Chicago is a private research university based in the urban center of Chicago,<br>
            the third most populous city in the United States. Outside of the Ivy League, Chicago is one of America’s <strong>top<br>
            universities</strong>, and holds top-ten positions in various national and international rankings.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago has a glowing reputation for its professional schools, including the Pritzker<br>
                School of Medicine, the Booth School of Business, and the Harris School of Public Policy Studies. University of<br>
                Chicago alumni are responsible for the development of many academic disciplines, such as sociology, economics,<br>
                law, and literary criticism.</p>
                
                <p>The college’s crest sees a phoenix rising from the ashes, a reference to the fire, foreclosure, and demolition of the<br>
                    Old University of Chicago campus, with the current University of Chicago emerging triumphantly in its place in 1890.<br>
                    The old university was founded through a land endowment from the controversial senator Stephen Douglas, a<br>
                    supporter of slavery who authored the Kansas-Nebraska act. By contrast, the new University of Chicago was co-<br>
                    educational and funded through donations from wealthy Chicagoans and the oil magnet John D. Rockefeller.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, the University of Chicago has approximately 16,000 students enrolled, with a male to female ratio of 56:44. A<br>
                        quarter of all students hail from overseas, a nod to the institution’s progressive credentials.</p>
                        
                        <p>Students run more than 400 clubs and societies, which consist of a typical mix of sports teams, arts, cultural and<br>
                            religious groups, academic and political groupings, and societies that promote eclectic common interests. Among<br>
                            the more famous examples are the University of Chicago bowl team, which has won 118 tournaments and 15 national<br>
                            championships, while the university's competitive Model United Nations team was the top ranked team in North<br>
                            America in 2013–14 and 2014–2015.</p>
                            
                            <p>If you have an interest in media and film, then you’re well catered for: the university is home to the longest<br>
                                continuously running student film society Doc Films and publishes several newspapers and magazines. Budding<br>
                                thespians can join renowned improvisational theater troupe Off-Off Campus or learn how to broadcast at the<br>
                                university-owned radio station WHPK.</p>
                                
                                <p>Notable faculty members past and present include 29 Nobel laureates and former US president Barack Obama.<br>
                                    Illustrious alumni come in practically every field, including the novelists Philip Roth and Saul Bellow, political movers<br>
                                    and shakers such as pollster Nate Silver and Obama strategist David Axelrod, pioneering balloonist Jeannette<br>

               to think differently. Our community pursues academic excellence, breaks<br>
               boundaries and makes a positive impact on real world problems.</p>
            
            <p><strong>An Academic Powerhouse</strong></p>
            <p>UCL is 8th in the world in the <em>“QS World University Rankings 2022.”</em> There<br>
                have been 30 Nobel laureates among its former staff and students; a winner<br>
                in every decade since the Prize started.</p>
                
                <p><strong>World Leading Research University</strong></p>
                <p>At the very heart of UCL’s mission is our research. We were rated the top<br>
                    university in the UK for research strength in the last Research Excellence<br>
                    Framework (REF 2014). We offer over 675 postgraduate taught, research<br>
                    and initial teacher education programmes across a wide range of disciplines,<br>
                    and encourage our community to work across traditional subject<br>
                    boundaries. UCL's research-based teaching methodology means that<br>
                    research is integrated into many of our degrees and students have the<br>
                    opportunity to make an original contribution to their field of study.</p>

                        of reasons, and we are deeply committed to supporting our student’s<br>
                        aspirations and enhancing their skills and employability. UCL Careers helps<br>

                    <p><strong>Study Climate Change at UCL</strong></p>
                    <p>A UCL education is a climate education. UCL students have the opportunity<br>
                        to delve into climate issues and make an impact through many of UCL's<br>
                        programmes of study.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our students bring new thinking on climate action; from designing solutions<br>

                    <p><strong>Generation One</strong></p>
                    <p>UCL is turning ground-breaking science and ideas into actions to tackle<br>
                        climate change.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the words of former US President, Barack Obama: “We are the<br>
                        first generation to feel the effect of climate change, and the last generation<br>
                        who can do something about it.” Generation One offers everyone the<br>
                        chance to understand the science behind the issues facing our planet. UCL<br>
                        is driving debate and solutions, empowering everyone to feel they can<br>
                        contribute, rather than being overwhelmed by the challenge.</p>

            <br>
            <p>ETH Zurich is one of the world's <em>leading</em> universities in science and technology and is known for its cutting-edge<br>
                research and innovation. It was established in 1855 as the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School, and a century and a half<br>
                later the university can count 21 Nobel laureates, 2 Fields Medalists, 3 Pritzker Prize winners, and 1 Turing Award<br>
                winner as alumni, including the great Albert Einstein himself.</p>
            <p>The university, officially called the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich in English, has 16 departments that<br>
                offer academic education and conduct scientific research in subjects ranging from engineering and architecture to<br>
                chemistry and physics.</p>
            <p>Education at ETH Zurich combines solid theory with practical application, and most degree programs build on strong<br>
                mathematical foundations. For undergraduates the main teaching language is German, while most master's<br>
                programs and doctoral studies are in English.</p>
            <p>Located in Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, ETH Zurich has two main locations: in downtown Zurich and on a<br>
                modern campus built on a hill in the outskirts of the town. Students at ETH face an intensive workload, but they can<br>
                still find time for cultural and other leisure activities and for attending the many regular symposia and conferences<br>
                on campus, where some of the best minds in science come to speak.</p>
            <p>ETH students like to exercise their bodies as well as their minds, and there is a wealth of various sports on offer on<br>
                campus. The largest annual event is the SOLA relay race , taking place in 14 sections over a total distance of 140<br>
                kilometers. More than 900 teams have been known to take part at once in the annual spectacle.</p>
            <p>Since the 1880s, students have also been able to show off their best moves at the Polyball, a classic ball event,<br>
                featuring live music by several orchestras and bands. Every November, 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers<br>
                descend on ETH’s extensively decorated main building for what is usually an unforgettable night.</p>

        <p>Ranked 7th in the world in the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021" target="_blank">QS World University Rankings® 2022</a>, <br>
            <strong>Imperial College London</strong> is a one-of-a-kind institution in the UK, focusing<br>
            solely on science, engineering, medicine and business. Imperial offers an<br>
            education that is research-led, exposing you to real world challenges with no<br>
            easy answers, teaching that opens everything up to question and<br>
            opportunities to work across multi-cultural, multi-national teams.</p>
        <p>Imperial is based in South Kensington in London, in an area known as<br>
            ‘Albertopolis’, Prince Albert and Sir Henry Cole’s 19th century vision for an<br>
            area where science and the arts would come together. As a result, Imperial’s<br>
            neighbours include a number of world leading cultural organizations<br>
            including the Science, Natural History and Victoria and Albert museums; the<br>
            Royal Colleges of Art and Music; and the Royal Albert Hall, where all of their<br>
            students also graduate.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of green space too, including two Royal Parks (Hyde Park<br>
            and Kensington Gardens) within 10 minutes’ walk of campus. Travel to and<br>
            from the area is also really easy as it’s served by three Tube lines and many<br>
            bus routes.</p>
        <p>One of the most distinctive elements of an Imperial education is that<br>
            students join a community of world-class researchers. The cutting edge and<br>
            globally influential nature of this research is what Imperial is best known for.<br>
            It’s the focus on the practical application of their research – particularly in<br>
            addressing global challenges – and the high level of interdisciplinary<br>
            collaboration that makes their research so effective. Read more about their<br>

            Fellowships</a> (Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering, Academy of<br>
            Medical Sciences) amongst their staff is a testament to the outstanding<br>
            contributions they have made in their respective fields.</p>
        <p>Imperial is one of the most international universities in the world, with 59%<br>

        <p><strong>COVID-19 Information:</strong></p>
        <p>Caltech is continuing to accept international students, although all arrivals at the university will have to initially follow<br>
            self-quarantine guidelines that apply to all travellers. All admission-related campus visit activities have been<br>
            suspended until further notice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is a world-renowned science and engineering research and<br>
            education institution, located in Pasadena, California, around 11 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Caltech has a high research output as well as many high-quality facilities such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br>
            (owned by NASA), the Caltech Seismological Laboratory, and the International Observatory Network. It’s among a<br>
            small group of institutes of technology in the United States primarily devoted to teaching technical arts and applied<br>
            sciences, and its fiercely competitive admissions process ensures only a small number of the most gifted students<br>
            are admitted.</p>
        <p>The university was founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, with the mission “to<br>
            expand human knowledge and benefit society through research integrated with education”. It became a major hub of<br>
            US scientific research in the early 20th century and was instrumental to the United States’ war effort during World<br>
            War II.</p>
        <p>Today, it is home to the Einstein Papers Project, an initiative seeking to preserve, translate and publish selected<br>
            papers from the estate of Albert Einstein. It has also established an energy innovation hub that aims to discovery<br>
            revolutionary methods of generating fuels directly from sunlight.</p>
        <p>Caltech’s 124-acre campus is within walking distance of Old Town Pasadena and the Pasadena Playhouse District,<br>
            and the two locations are frequent getaways for students. Life on campus is rich with social activities, clubs,<br>
            associations and recreational facilities. Intercollegiate sport is taken very seriously, with the Caltech Beavers (the<br>
            beaver – nature’s engineer – is the college’s mascot) competing in 13 intercollegiate sports.</p>
        <p>Caltech also offers excellent opportunities for the study and performance of music, theater, and the visual arts, all<br>
            activities that play a vital role in realizing Caltech’s mission to role in realizing the Institute's mission of "educating<br>
            outstanding students to become creative members of society". Providing a touch of grandeur, the Athenaeum is a<br>
            stately building in the center of the campus where members can go for formal and informal dining, meetings,<br>
            rendezvous and private parties.</p>
        <p>The <em>balance</em> at Caltech between a rigorous academic curriculum and activities that promote personal development<br>
            ensures time spent there for students is both formative and an invaluable staging post to a successful career.<br>
            Although it may lack the reputation of Ivy League universities or the likes of Oxford and Cambridge, Caltech is<br>
            undoubtedly one of the best universities in the world, a fact reflected in all the university rankings, which regularly<br>
            single out technology and engineering as the school’s key academic strengths.</p>

        </figure>
        <p><strong>COVID-19 Information:</strong></p>
        <p>International students that have been invited to study at Harvard University are advised to contact their academic<br>
            department for more information. While the admissions office is closed, staff can be contacted by email and<br>
            telephone. No information sessions or tours will be cancelled.</p>
        <p>Visitas - Harvard’s weekend for admitted students - is now being held virtually.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Established in 1636, Harvard is the oldest higher education institution in the United States, and is widely regarded in<br>
            terms of its influence, reputation, and academic pedigree as a leading university in not just the US but also the<br>
            world.</p>
        <p>Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, three miles north-west of Boston, Harvard’s 209-acre campus houses 10<br>
            degree-granting schools in addition to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, two theaters, and five museums. It<br>
            is also home to the largest academic library system in the world, with 18 million volumes, 180,000 serial titles, an<br>
            estimated 400 million manuscript items and 10 million photographs.</p>
        <p>Like most of the United States’ pre-Civil War colleges, Harvard was founded to train clergy, but Harvard’s curriculum<br>
            and student body quickly secularized, and in the 20th century admissions policy was opened up to bring in a more<br>
            diverse pool of applicants.</p>
        <p>Now, a total of 21,000 students attend the university, each of whom at some point can be seen bustling past the<br>
            famous statue of John Harvard, the university’s first benefactor and founder, which looks on benignly in the center<br>
            of the campus. The bronze statue’s gleaming foot is due to almost incessant rubbing by tourists and students, who<br>
            believe the act brings good luck.</p>
        <p>Only the academic elite can claim a place at Harvard, and the nominal cost of attendance is high – though the<br>
            university’s hefty endowment is such that it can offer generous financial aid packages, which around 60 per cent of<br>
            students take advantage of.</p>
        <p>As freshmen, students live in one of the dormitories in Harvard Yard, a prime location, and eat in the historic and<br>
            picturesque Annenberg dining hall. Harvard students are active around and beyond campus, with over 400 official<br>
            student societies including extracurricular, co-curricular and athletic opportunities. Whether playing on the field in<br>
            Harvard Stadium, fostering entrepreneurial activities at the Harvard innovation lab or writing and editing at the daily<br>
            newspaper the Harvard Crimson, student life is a rich and rewarding experience.</p>
        <p>Harvard's alumni include eight US presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes<br>
            Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars. Whether it be Pulitzer Prizes, Nobel Prizes, or Academy Awards, Harvard<br>
            graduates have won them. Students and alumni have also won 108 Olympic medals between them. The university is<br>
            regularly ranked number one in the world, and the consistency of its chart-topping performances shows that success<br>
            is yet to breed complacency.</p>

        <p><strong>COVID-19 Information:</strong></p>
        <p>UK students with an offer from the University of Cambridge are advised to wait for further information from the<br>
            university. The university is working hard to minimize the impact on admissions and is consulting with UCAS and<br>
            other bodies, while waiting for further government advice.</p>
        <p>International students who must take an English-language test should check for updates on when IELTS and TOEFL<br>
            test centers will reopen.</p>
        <p>All offer holders are instructed to keep a log of any disruption they experience, so the university can treat all<br>
            candidates equitably. Students are not required to send this information now, but may be asked to provide it in the<br>
            future.</p>
        <p>All events and open days have been cancelled until further notice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Located in the center of the ancient city of Cambridge, 50 miles north of London, the University of Cambridge is a<br>
            collegiate public research institution that serves more than 18,000 students from all corners of the globe.</p>
        <p>The university consists of numerous listed buildings and is divided into 31 autonomous colleges, with many of the<br>
            older ones situated on the famous river Cam. Applications are made directly to the individual colleges, rather than to<br>
            the university overall. You can live and are often taught within your college, receiving small group teaching sessions<br>
            known as college supervisions.</p>
        <p>Six academic schools – Arts and Humanities, Biological Sciences, Clinical Medicine, Humanities and Social Sciences,<br>
            Physical Sciences, and Technology – are spread across the university’s colleges, housing roughly 150 faculties and<br>
            other institutions.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge’s 800-year history makes it the fourth-oldest university in the world<br>
            and the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world. Cambridge students make up 20 percent of the<br>
            town's population and most of the older colleges are situated near the city center. Its notable buildings give the city<br>
            of Cambridge a unique character, and include King's College Chapel, the history faculty building designed by James<br>
            Stirling and the Cripps Building at St John's College.</p>
        <p>Cambridge is widely acknowledged as a vibrant place to be a student. On the academic side, the university is home<br>
            to over 100 libraries, which hold more than 15 million books in total. There are also nine world-renowned arts,<br>
            scientific and cultural museums such as Kettle’s Yard and the Fitzwilliam Museum, which are open to the public<br>
            throughout the year, as well as a botanical garden.</p>
        <p>Extracurricular activities give you the chance to get involved with anything from the university’s renowned student<br>
            drama societies, which spawned the likes of comedy group Monty Python, to music, politics and hundreds of other<br>
            clubs and societies. The sports scene at Cambridge is huge too, with state-of-the-art facilities and over 80 sports<br>
            on offer with teams for novices and experts alike.</p>
        <p>With its reputation for academic excellence and traditional scholarly values, the University of Cambridge often ranks<br>
            among the very top universities in the world for teaching, research, and international outlook. The university has<br>
            educated eminent mathematicians, scientists, politicians, lawyers, philosophers, writers, actors and heads of state.<br>
            Ninety-eight Nobel laureates and 15 British prime ministers have affiliations with Cambridge as students, faculty or<br>
            alumni, including the scientists Francis Crick and Frederick Sanger.</p>

        <p>The Stanford Office of Undergraduate Admission has been closed until further notice. Applications continue to be<br>
            processed, however, and the office can be contacted via email. All tours, programs and information sessions for<br>
            prospective students have been cancelled and the Visitor Center is also closed until further notice.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Located 35 miles south of San Francisco and 20 miles north of San Jose, Stanford University is in the heart of<br>
            Northern California’s dynamic Silicon Valley, home to Yahoo, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and many other cutting-<br>
            edge tech companies that were founded by and continue to be led by Stanford alumni and faculty. Nicknamed the<br>
            “billionaire factory”, it is said that if Stanford graduates formed their own country it would boast one of the world’s<br>
            largest ten economies.largest ten economies.</p>
        <p>Covering 8,180 acres, Stanford has one of the largest university campuses in the US, with 18 interdisciplinary<br>
            research institutes and seven schools: the Graduate School of Business; School of Earth, Energy & Environmental<br>
            Sciences; Graduate School of Education; School of Engineering; School of Humanities and Sciences; Law School;<br>
            and School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Stanford University was founded in 1885 by California senator Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, to “promote the<br>
            public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization”. The couple’s only child had died of<br>
            typhoid, and their decision to build a university on their farm was intended as a memorial. From the start the<br>
            university was non-sectarian, co-educational and affordable, teaching both the traditional liberal arts and the<br>
            technology and engineering that was shaping the new America at the time.</p>
        <p>Fast forward more than a century, and Stanford counts 19 Nobel laureates within its community and is regularly<br>
            ranked among the top three universities in the world. Nicknamed “The Farm” from the days when horses roamed<br>
            there, Stanford’s campus is now a thriving community of more than 11,000 creative and accomplished people from<br>
            around the world. Nearly all undergraduate and 60 per cent of graduate students live on campus, so it is hardly<br>
            surprising that student life is rich and diverse, with over 625 organized student groups.</p>
        <p>Sport is popular, with students, faculty and staff enjoying state-of-the-art recreational facilities and wellness<br>
            programs. Stanford students compete in 36 varsity and 32 club sports, including baseball, football, basketball, and<br>
            squash. Sports teams are referred to as the “Stanford Cardinal”.</p>
        <p>Stanford also has a rich tradition of fostering creativity and the arts: there is a vibrant campus arts district and two<br>
            world-class museums which host regular exhibitions.  Eight dining halls, a teaching kitchen and organic gardens<br>
            provide the campus community with healthy, sustainable meals. The close-knit communal nature of life on campus<br>
            has even given rise to “Stanford speak”, a special language only spoken on campus.</p>

        <p><strong>COVID-19 Information:</strong></p>
        <p>As UK schools have largely closed and exams will no longer be taking place, the University of Oxford is awaiting<br>
            further information from the government on how qualifications (i.e. A-Levels) will be awarded. More information for<br>
            both domestic and international offer-holders will be made available as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Graduate applications are still being processed by the university - an online form has been provided on the university<br>
            website for any queries. If you need to take an English-language test, the university currently has a deadline of the<br>
            UK summer. If test centers around the world do not reopen in time, the university will provide further guidance on<br>
            how to proceed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The University of Oxford is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and is actually so ancient that its<br>
            founding date is unknown – though it is thought that teaching took place there as early as the 11th century.</p>
        <p>It’s located in and around the medieval city center of Oxford, dubbed “the dreaming city of spires” by the 19th<br>
            century poet Matthew Arnold, and comprises 44 colleges and halls as well as the largest library system in the UK.</p>
        <p>There are 22,000 students at Oxford in total, around half of whom are undergraduates, while 40 per cent are<br>
            international students. A quarter of the city of Oxford’s residents are students, giving the city the youngest<br>
            population in the UK.</p>
        <p>The University of Oxford does not have a main campus, its buildings and facilities instead being scattered around the<br>
            medieval city center. Its colleges each have a distinctive character and traditions often dating back centuries.<br>
            Colleges are self-governing institutions to which students usually apply directly. There are four academic divisions<br>
            within Oxford University: Humanities, Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; and Social<br>
            Sciences. The university’s particular strength is the sciences, and it is ranked number one in the world for medicine.</p>
        <p>Oxford is a youthful and cosmopolitan city with plenty to see and do. There are dozens of historic and iconic<br>
            buildings, including the Bodleian Libraries, Ashmolean Museum, Sheldonian Theatre, the cathedral, and the colleges<br>
            themselves.</p>
        <p>Students can choose to spend their time studying or avail themselves of the many extracurricular activities available.<br>
            There’s a strong musical life at Oxford, with clubs and societies spanning all genres, from jazz, through to classical<br>
            and folk. Oxford is also ranked highly for sport, with its top rowers taking part every year in the world-famous boat<br>
            race with the University of Cambridge on the River Thames. Drama lovers are also well catered for, with one of the<br>
            largest and most vibrant university drama scenes in the country.</p>
        <p>Oxford has an alumni network of over 250,000 individuals, including more than 120 Olympic medalists, 26 Nobel<br>
            Prize winners, seven poets laureate, and over 30 modern world leaders (including Bill Clinton, Aung San Suu Kyi,<br>
            Indira Ghandi and 26 UK Prime Ministers).</p>
        <p>It has a friendly rivalry with Cambridge for the title of best university in the UK and is regularly ranked as being one of<br>
            the top three universities in the world. Notable Oxford thinkers and scientists include Tim Berners-Lee, Stephen<br>
            Hawking and Richard Dawkins.</p>

        <p><strong>COVID-19 Information:</strong></p>
        <p>MIT has cancelled information sessions and tours for prospective students. The on-campus admissions office is also<br>
            closed indefinitely, although they are still answering emails and phone calls. The university has assured students<br>
            whose education has been interrupted by COVID-19 that they will not be penalized in the admissions process.</p>
        <p>MIT will also not host or sponsor any in-person K-12 student programming through the summer of 2020. Instead,<br>
            efforts are being made to ensure students and their families can learn everything they need to about campus<br>
            through some kind of online delivery system.</p>
        <br>
        <p>“Mind and Hand” is the thought-provoking motto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, known also as MIT.<br>
            This motto enigmatically encapsulates this famous institution’s mission to advance knowledge in science, technology<br>
            and areas of scholarship that can help to make the world a better place.</p>
        <p>At its founding in 1861, MIT was initially a small community of problem-solvers and science lovers eager to bring their<br>
            knowledge to bear on the world. Today, MIT has evolved into an educational behemoth, with some 1,000 faculty<br>
            members and more than 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
        <p>MIT is now an independent, coeducational, privately endowed university organized into five schools (architecture<br>
            and planning; engineering; humanities, arts, and social sciences; management; science). Yet the principle of<br>
            educational innovation remains at the core of MIT’s educational philosophy.</p>
        <p>MIT researchers are at the forefront of developments in artificial intelligence, climate adaptation, HIV, cancer, and<br>
            poverty alleviation, while in the past MIT research has fuelled scientific breakthroughs such as the development of<br>
            radar, the invention of magnetic core memory and the concept of the expanding universe.</p>
        <p>Science and technology are not the only strings to MIT’s bow, however. Approximately 20 percent of MIT<br>
            undergraduates join a sports team, and with 33 varsity sports MIT boasts one of the broadest intercollegiate athletic<br>
            programs in the world.</p>
        <p>A vibrant arts culture also permeates college life. There are 12 museums and galleries on campus, with the MIT<br>
            Museum drawing nearly 125,000 visitors each year. Students participate in more than 60 music, theatre, writing and<br>
            dance groups, and faculty members of MIT even include Pulitzer Prize winners and Guggenheim fellows.</p>
        <p>MIT is set in 168 acres of grounds that extend for more than a mile along the Cambridge side of the Charles River<br>
            basin. The campus features stunning landmarks designed by the likes of architects Alvar Aalto, Frank Gehry, and<br>
            Steven Hollin, as well as buildings in a range of architectural styles, from neoclassical to modernist and brutalist.</p>
        <p>At its edges, the campus merges with various Cambridge neighborhoods, including Kendall Square which is one of<br>
            the most innovative square miles on the planet. The close association of industry and research has helped MIT<br>
            alumni go on to launch more than 30,000 active companies, creating 4.6 million jobs and generating roughly $1.9<br>
            trillion in annual revenue. No wonder then that a nation of MIT graduates would be equivalent to the 10th-largest<br>
            economy in the world.</p>
